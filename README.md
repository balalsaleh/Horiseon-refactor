# Horiseon-refactor

I have used the starter code to make changes and refactor the Horiseon index.html and css file.

## Here I have used the HTML5 standards:

- Meta name tages for description and for keywords added this as it should help the searchability of the website
- Using a header element for the header section of the website.
- Turned the div class = hero into a section class = hero.
- Turned the div class for content into a img element as it using an image.
- Turned the div class into a main element as this is the main section of the page.
- No longer using div elements for the content, now using sections.
- All images now have a alternative text attribute
- The benefits is now an aside element, as this is this seperate from the main part of the web page.
- Now using articles for each benefit on the webpage as these are seperate benefits which could be used individually instead of divs.
- Now using a footer element instead of a div element.

The changes I have made all meet the current HTML5 standards.

## CSS changes

- I have made specific changes for the CSS file to reduce repeating code.
